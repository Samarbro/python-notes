'''
Whenever we want to call a function, we put the name
of the function followed by 
parentheses as follows:
'''
    

def func1():
    print('hello')
    
    
func1() # function call
func1()
func1()    # As many times the function is called, that many times the output (is produced€€)
func1()
func1()
