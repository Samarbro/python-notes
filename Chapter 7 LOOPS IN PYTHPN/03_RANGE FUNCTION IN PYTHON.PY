'''   The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of 
number.

We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follows:

'''


# range(start, stop size)
# step size is usually not used with range()


# FOR EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING RANGE () FUNCTION.

for i in range(0,7): # range(7) can also be used 
    
    print(i) # print ) 0 to 6
